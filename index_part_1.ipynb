    "This project is an in-depth analysis of music from the music streaming service [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/). In it, I scrape a large number of tracks from [my personal Spotify music library](https://open.spotify.com/user/nxbrnt/playlist/1ypVHzjgXq07PwQR7SBcGU?si=d56V5YZ-Q1y4FhiWzXN0gg) (~6000 tracks) as well as the [Billboard Year-End Hot 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100) from every year since 1960 (~6000 tracks) using [Spotify's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/). After merging and wrangling this data into a usable dataframe, I thoroughly explore and visualize the tracks' features using extensively customized plotting functions. While my primary goal is to find predictive signals in the features that distinguish between the two datasets, I discover many interesting patterns along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [follow-up project](index_part_2.ipynb), I use these insights to build a classifier to distinguish between these datasets, and to build a personalized track recommender.\n",

    "## Tools \n",
    "The project is coded in **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** using **[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)** notebooks. The **[spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)** python package is used to interface with the **[Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)**. The data is stored and transformed using primarily **[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** and **[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)**. All custom plots are designed using **[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)**, **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)**, and **[Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)**. **[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org)** is used for some simple regression. All text is written in **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)**, with equations written in **[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)**.\n",
